\begin{abstract}
\noindent The original Internet was envisioned to become an open and distributed network that was scalable and fair, allowing access to data and services without surveillance or security concerns. However, in recent years, the network has become increasingly centralized, controlled and monopolized by big businesses running huge data centers. This centralization has given big entities and businesses unprecedented control of the traffic and data of the network.

\noindent With ownership of the majority of resources on the Internet owned by a minority of corporations, they're able to maintain a high cost to value ratio along with making your personal data less secure. As a remedy to this deteriorating trend, we suggest the inception of a decentralized and consensus-driven segmented blockchain network based on a striped storage solution. The protocol allows for a completely decentralized and secure blockchain-based Internet where any user, including private persons, can host an income-generating service node, aiding the network with compute cycles, bandwidth, and storage space. To allow for complete utilization of the network, an access layer is provided, allowing for the development of protocols, services, and infrastructure.

\section{Problem}
The current Internet is dominated by large multi-national conglomerates. With names like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon taking up vast segments of the total market. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is said to have 49.4\% market share \cite{jeb2019}.

A near majority of all Internet data is stored on servers owned by a single entity \cite{jeb2019}. As a consequence, this results in much of the current traffic being routed through Amazonâ€™s servers and data centers \cite{jeb2019}. Because of this, important routes often get overloaded during peak hours, slowing down services - resulting in a degraded user experience. In fact, routes regularly become so overloaded that it effectively causes servers on the other end of the communication queue to be unreachable - something most Internet users have experienced. If your provider goes offline or gets disrupted - your service and data becomes unreachable.

The centralized nature of the resource ownership on the Internet also results in under-utilization of servers, with idle CPU cycles and gigabytes or potentially terabytes of unused storage space on a single server. This is especially true when businesses choose to cost-optimize their operations and rely on their own dedicated servers, rather than relying on the more expensive cloud provider solutions.

In some countries, Internet censorship is so prevalent that the public is limited to what news resources they are allowed to access and view \cite{wiki2021}. The original intention of the Internet was to create an open and globally accessible network, allowing everybody with access to view and take part of that information, regardless of their originating location.

For privacy, cost and security reasons, this situation is not sustainable. Hackers, oppressive governments and monopolizing businesses continuously develop better tools to infringe on your data and privacy - creating a very vulnerable situation.

\section{Background}
The primary goal of Unigrid is to implement an anonymous and decentralized communication solution that offers data storage and compute cycle utilization. Private individuals and businesses that value privacy or require secure data storage as a use case can take advantage of his feature.

As an example, sensitive documents such as medical records, can be stored on-chain and only shared with selected individuals or entities. The data can be shared using a key that has an expiration timer, meaning that the sharing party never has to worry about the risk that the data will be exposed or accessed by an unwanted party. It should be the owning individual or business that controls how their private data is accessed and shared. It should never be in the control of a third party - something that is usually the case today. When the data is controlled by a third party, the risk of information leak increases dramatically. Sometimes data is stolen by hackers. Other times it is leaked or shared on purpose (in secrecy or otherwise). Whatever the reason - the Unigrid network gives the control back to the user or the party that actually owns the data.

Another example is the growing IoT (Internet of Things) market. On a blockchain, the ledger is tamper-proof, removing the need for absolute trust between two communicating parties. Utilizing a blockchain network like Unigrid adds a layer of trust to the data being transmitted. On top of handling the integrity of the actual data, the network also needs to be capable of scaling without degradation when millions of IoT-connected devices join the network. As mentioned by Shruti Jain of Deloitte \cite{jain2021}, blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to help address some of the IoT security and scalability challenges.

\subsection{Gridnodes}
A gridnode is similar in function to a masternode as initially conceived by the Darkcoin project, where anybody can set-up a node on a server by locking up a certain amount of tokens to that node. These masternodes then provide a service to the network by contributing network bandwidth in the form of helping other nodes to synchronize and verify blocks on the network. Because these masternodes secure the network in this way, they are rewarded in tokens.

The Unigrid takes this idea further and implements gridnodes. Gridnodes are scored by the quality of the service they provide to the network and it's nodes. For example, latency, the amount of available storage capacity, processing speed and network bandwidth are all taken into account. Each gridnode is then scored based on how they rank compared to other gridnodes.

With a regular masternode, reward frequency and occurrence is based on a naively calculated list. The network simply stores this list into memory and will cycle through each block to select the next winner. With the Unigrid network and gridnodes, scoring and rewards work differently. For example, when a request is made to store data on the network, there will be a check performed - looking for the next gridnode candidate. This check will see which gridnode has received the last reward plus scan the scores of each gridnode. Once a winner is selected, this gridnode will collect the data submitted and work with the other gridnodes to shard it across the network. This sharding allows the network to scale efficiently.

\subsection{Side chains}
The Unigrid network places work in appropriate side chains based on the type of work currently being sent by a communicating node. Each side chain is controlled by a group of gridnodes. A side chain is a specialized blockchain with very specific characteristics, optimized for the type of work it is meant for. For example, data storage and compute cycles don't need the brute speed that a direct communication channel requires. Therefore, the Unigrid network treats these workloads differently. The communication side chains are smaller and kept in-memory, using a very fast but less collision resistant hashing algorithm. The blockchains that handle compute cycles and storage, on the other hand, are more resistant to hash collisions - making them very secure. However, they can not handle the same throughput as the in-memory chains using the less resistant hashing variant.

\subsection{Data storage}
The design of the Unigrid network allows it to store large amounts of data on-chain that can be accessed at any time. The data stored on the network is either public or private. Public data is viewable by anybody with access to the network. Private data, on the other hand, is only be accessible via a private key and has to be decrypted in order to allow access to the data.

Cloud data storage is projected to reach a market size of \$297.54 billion by 2027 \cite{fort2021} and might even grow bigger if networks such as Unigrid reach big general adoption. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are tokens where only one specific token can be in existence at a given time. These allow for proof of ownership of a digital asset. The problem with the current system is that the only thing being stored on-chain is the actual proof of ownership. The asset itself that an NFT is tethered to is actually stored on a normal web server or some other means of storage. Consequently, if that web server or storage shuts down or is moved, the data for that NFT is lost.

The Unigrid network, is a perfect solution for handling NFTs and digital assets. Thanks to the redundancy, fault-tolerance and side chains of the network, the actual asset data can be stored in a way that ensures it can never be removed or lost by accident. This provides more long-term solution to where assets, that in some cases cost millions of dollars, are permanently and securely stored.

The NFT market has exploded in the past year. According to Joseph Young of Forbes, the market cap has grown an astounding 1758\% \cite{young2021}.

\subsection{Sharding \& Parity Blocks}
In a typical blockchain, data is stored in a vertical structure with each new block being appended to the previous block. However, this is not an ideal solution when yo want to create a low latency network capable of fast data access and transfers. The solution to solve this problem on the Unigrid network involves sharding data across multiple blockchains. Furthermore, parity blocks are introduced to achieve redundancy and fault tolerance. The result is a network built for speed, security and scalability.

Sharding is a database architecture pattern related to horizontal partitioning - the practice of separating one tableâ€™s rows into multiple different tables, known as partitions \cite{mark2019}. Data on the Unigrid network will be sharded across nodes into group swarms called shard groups. This allows the network to become a self-replicating CDN (Content Delivery Network) where data is preferably pulled from the most optimal location. This minimizes the network latency currently experienced on the modern web where you may be pulling data from a webpage in one centrally installed location.

In a shard group, you will also be able to run a container or VPS (Virtual Private Server), utilizing the resources available in this group. These containers can be auto deployed on the network utilizing Kubernetes (an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications).

A video streaming service is a good example of something that could take take advantage of the network and the available speeds. As the video stored on the network would be sharded and spread out on the network, users viewing the video would always loaded content from the fastest gridnode swarm with the lowest latency.

\subsection{Compute cycles}
As the network grows and more gridnodes come online so will it's compute power. Since the requirements of the network to run a gridnode will be high this also means there will be a large amount of computational power available to the network. Organizations and or users will be able to rent compute cycles. 

One use case of this could be a scientific study that needs to run some very complex computationally intensive tasks. These compute cycles will be available to rent on the network in return those gridnodes being used are awarded in Unigrid.

\subsection{Domain registry}
Since at its core Unigrid is its own network users will also be able to secure domain names. The registration fees for a domain will in turn be allocated to gridnodes that handle the tasks.

As more domains are registered on the network it also makes sense to allow for people to trade these domains. A domain market will be created to allow users to buy and trade domain names. This will function similarly to an NFT auction where you can bid on domains and set expire of sale times.

According to John Levine at CircleID \cite{john2018} the domain registrar business is at \$3 to \$5 billion per year and growing.

\subsection{Migration}
Connecting to the Internet exposes personal data about you and your personal information to nefarious parties. To protect yourself from this a lot of people choose to use a VPN(Virtual Private Network). This helps protect your personal data by creating an encrypted tunnel to the Internet.

With the Unigrid network, a connection is made with a proxy and a fingerprint is assigned. A gridnode will pick this up and act as the "outlet" for that connection. With this fingerprint, the network knows this traffic is meant for the network. There is no way to know who the originating user is or where they are from in this method. The data being sent is also encrypted through this proxy tunnel. The gridnodes themselves act as a swarm of proxies, unlike TOR which more resembles a chain.

\subsection{Governance}
Control of the network itself and what is allowed and not allowed will be given to the gridnodes. A voting system will be put in place to allow scrambling of data the network does not deem fit to be on the chain. Any major updates to the network itself will be voted on by the gridnodes as well.

\subsection{Decentralization Attempts}
Many projects claim decentralization, but in reality most require specialized hardware and do not allow nodes to democratically contribute to the network - some even require written applications and employ a vetting process.

This effectively moves the centralization to another point of failure rather than solving the underlying problem.

With Unigrid, anyone will be able to join the network and become a gridnode host. This in turn democratizes the network - giving each gridnode a vote on proposals.

\subsection{Market Adoption}
We plan to organize hackathons and events to promote growth and development on the Unigrid network. 

The Unigrid Foundation will be working to partner with universities and scientific research organizations. We will allocate a certain percentage of compute cycles and data storage to these institutions. There are also plans to create grant programs which can be applied to and allow access to funds from the foundation to further the development and adoption of the network.

An open VPN service will also be created on the network to gain traction.

\subsection{Competitive Advantage}
We will be able to keep the costs down of both data storage and processing data. The gridnodes themselves will set a price they are willing to accept for the service. With on network competition, costs will be drastically lower than the alternatives. If a gridnode sets their price to high the network will in turn send them fewer tasks.

Data on the network is automatically backed up and spread across the network for redundancy. If one gridnode goes down data is accessible from other nodes in the same region.

On Unigrid your data will always be online and accessible. The network itself will never go offline so you always have access to your data and apps.

\subsection{Foundational Structure}
Overseen by the county administrative board of the region, helping to ensure that assets are properly managed.

Developing a public utility under a Swedish foundation that is socially beneficial grants several tax benefits and allows the foundation to minimize tax expenditures, increasing funding for internal development and research sponsorship into the fields of distributed communication and storage.

Investments into high-yield assets with additional returns from the Unigrid network will allow the foundation to be self-funding after the initial public sale.

\section{Token Metrics \& Sale}
The Unigrid Foundation is conducting a series of sales rounds in order to finance initial development of the network. Three sales rounds in total will conducted with an additional angel funding round to accredited investors and venture capital firms. The tokens for the angel round are taken from the 20 million tokens up for sale in the first sales round. Angel investors get a discount and are able to buy these tokens at \$0.75 rather than the \$1.00-\$1.25 sales price specified in the actual round. Also, if the foundation sells all 20 million tokens in the initial angel round, the sales round scheduled for October 2021 will not include sales of any tokens from the foundation. Instead, the foundation will shift it's focus to the second sales round scheduled for October 2022. The following sales rounds are planned:

\noindent Any tokens not sold in each round will be placed under the care of the foundation for future use. Because of the proof of stake nature of the  network, investments for a single entity are capped at three million tokens per investor. The biggest investors that want to work with us to bring the network into fruition will, at the discretion of the foundation, be offered a board seat on the foundation board.

\section{Conclusion}
Since the advent of the Internet in the 1960's\cite{int1997} the Internet has been nodes (computers) communicating with each other. What we plan on doing with Unigrid is decentralizing these nodes to where anyone can partake in being a host node on the Internet. From the first contact with the network, your data is encrypted and then sharded making it practically impossible for anyone else to access this data without a key. Browsing across the network is also anonymous by default securing your privacy rights.

\noindent Gridnodes are the backbone to the network and an integral role in how the system functions. For the services provided, they will be rewarded. According to the research company, Gartner the total market share for IaaS cloud infrastructure in 2019 was \$38.9 billion with a projected growth to \$76.6 billion by 2022\cite{gartner2019}. If we look at these numbers you can see the potential an open-source decentralized network will play here.
